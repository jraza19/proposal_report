Introduction
=======================

Lipohypertrophy is a common complication for diabetic patients who inject insulin (Kapeluto et al., 2018). It is defined as the growth of fat cells and fibrous tissue with lowered vascularity in the skin following repeated trauma of insulin injection in the same area. Our focus is on subclinical hypertrophy which forms in the subcutaneous layer (the deepest layer of the skin) (Lumen, 2021). It is critical that insulin is not injected into areas of lipohypertrophy as it reduces the effectiveness of the insulin such that patients are unable to manage their blood sugar levels and may require more insulin to achieve the same therapeutic benefits (Kapeluto et al., 2018). Fortunately, research by Kapeluto et al. (2018) has found ultrasound imaging techniques are more accurate in finding these masses than a physical examination of the body by a healthcare professional. But, currently, the criteria to classify lipohypertrophy using ultrasound imaging is only implemented by a small group of physicians (Madden, 2021). To expand the usability of this criteria to a larger set of healthcare professionals, the capstone partner is interested in seeing if we could leverage supervised machine learning techniques to accurately classify the presence of lipohypertrophy given an ultrasound image. 

Therefore, our objective as the data science team is to build a binary classification convolutional neural network (CNN) model that classifies an ultrasound image into two classes, lipohypertrophy present or lipohypertrophy is not present. A CNN model is a common technique used to classify image data into binary categories. Furthermore, we would like to utilize object detection techniques to classify, given a positive lipohypertrophy site, the exact area of its location on an ultrasound image.


There are three identified levels of technical abstraction for the final data product. The first level of abstraction and the minimum viable product for this capstone project is a well-documented and reproducible machine learning pipeline. The source code from this analysis acts as a proof-of-concept for using a supervised learning approach to address the problem of detecting subclinical lipohypertrophy. The second level of abstraction includes deploying the model to a cloud-based service and creating an interface where users will be able to interact with it to obtain predictions on unseen data. The final level of abstraction is creating a python application using tools such as pyinstaller. This would allow healthcare workers to easily interact with our final data product without any prior knowledge of programming.
