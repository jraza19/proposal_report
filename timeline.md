Timeline
=======================

We have divided our project up into 3 phases.

- In Phase 1 (weeks 1 to 3), we aim to configure the most appropriate image pre-processing and CNN architectures by testing a variety of transfer learning techniques. 

- In Phase 2 (weeks 4 to 6), we aim to implement higher levels of sophistication to our data product to improve its accessibility to a non-technical audience. 

- In Phase 3 (weeks 6 to 8), we aim to complete our final data product, final report, and final presentation and add additional functionality such as object detection if time permits.
